## The Story

I am currently working as a quality control analyst in a biotech company. But my true passion and the greatest strength lie in engineering design and the computational simulation of Multiphysics systems. To address this conflict, for the last few years, I have been diligently honing and enriching my skill sets. And now I am confident that I possess the aptitude, tenacity, and necessary background to professionally transition into the domain of my interest. Therefore, I am seeking a career in engineering modeling, simulation, and computation to solve complex technical challenges. I will bring a multitude of transferable skill sets, rich interdisciplinary background, solid work commitment, and refined enthusiasm in the job.
