## Hello there! I am happy that you made it here!

## I am passionate at leveraging Multiphysics simulation, MATLAB, CAD, Machine Learning, Mathematical Modeling, and Python programming for solving complicated technical problems. I have spearheaded dozens of engineering modeling and simulation projects, and authored to seven research publications. With an advanced degree in electrical and computer engineering, I specialized in Multiphysics modelling, algorithm development, system simulation, data analysis, quality control, and product prototyping. Dedicated to quality control and continuous learning, I am aspiring to be an expert in engineering system & process design, modeling, and computation by utilizing my wealth of multi-disciplinary knowledge base.

## I write poem sometimes and this is one of my favorite!


They will cut your pocket to fill-it with wanting hand

Even at extreme frugality you will withstand

You will stand not just to stand but to take a stand

You will lend not just to lend but to help other to mend

You will deny not because you will fear the course

It will be the truth, what you will endorse

You are the force fostering the change

Go as far as edge, of your range

If you stuck at any bend

If you can't make it to the end

You shouldn't need to feel short

Plenty of warriors are still remaining in the fort

Remember! You will lend not just to lend but to help other to mend ; you will stand not just to stand but to take a stand!



## I love staying fit by regualar workout, meditation, and self-affirmation and this is me!
