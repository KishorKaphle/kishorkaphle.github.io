### Capillary Simulation in COMSOL

**Overview:**  
Imagine designing a terry towel or bandage—materials that need maximum fluid absorption. The absorption process is governed by capillary action, which depends on fiber geometry and the liquid-gas contact angle. This tutorial dives into how Multiphysics simulation can optimize such designs.

**Content:**  
1. **Introduction to Capillary Action**: Learn how fiber geometry and contact angles influence liquid absorption.  
2. **Simulation Approach**:  
   - Simulate capillary rise profiles for varying angles (30°, 45°, 68°).  
   - Validate results with theoretical studies, achieving 98% accuracy.

**Key Findings:**  
- Lower contact angles result in higher capillary rise.  
- Optimization focuses on fiber material and diameter for maximum fluid absorption.

**Pro Tips for COMSOL Simulation:**  
1. Adjust phase field parameters for better approximations.  
2. Define fluid properties correctly (fluid 1: gas, fluid 2: liquid).  
3. Use "suppress backflow" and hydrostatic pressure compensation as needed.

**Video Tutorial:**
