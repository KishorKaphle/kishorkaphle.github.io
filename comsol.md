## Capillary Simulation in COMSOL

**Overview:**  
Imagine designing a terry towel or bandage—materials that need maximum fluid absorption. The absorption process is governed by capillary action, which depends on fiber geometry and the liquid-gas contact angle. This tutorial dives into how Multiphysics simulation can optimize such designs.

**Content:**  
1. **Introduction to Capillary Action**: Learn how fiber geometry and contact angles influence liquid absorption.  
2. **Simulation Approach**:  
   - Simulate capillary rise profiles for varying angles (30°, 45°, 68°).  
   - Validate results with theoretical studies, achieving 98% accuracy.

**Key Findings:**  
- Lower contact angles result in higher capillary rise.  
- Optimization focuses on fiber material and diameter for maximum fluid absorption.

**Pro Tips for COMSOL Simulation:**  
1. Adjust phase field parameters for better approximations.  
2. Define fluid properties correctly (fluid 1: gas, fluid 2: liquid).  
3. Use "suppress backflow" and hydrostatic pressure compensation as needed.

# Comprehensive Guide: Designing Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Devices in COMSOL

## Introduction
Welcome to this tutorial on designing Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) devices using COMSOL Multiphysics. This guide provides step-by-step instructions, covering essential aspects of SAW device modeling for efficient simulations.

SAW devices are crucial in various applications such as sensors and telecommunications. Their ability to convert electrical signals into mechanical waves makes them valuable in modern technology. However, accurate modeling of SAW devices requires careful attention to materials, geometries, and wave interactions.

This tutorial will help you build and optimize SAW devices while addressing common design challenges.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Model
Start by launching COMSOL and selecting the **appropriate physics interfaces** for acoustics and piezoelectric materials. Define the SAW device structure, including:
- **Substrate Material:** 128° YZ-cut Lithium Niobate (LiNbO₃)
- **Interdigital Transducers (IDTs)**
- **Reflectors**

Ensure that the dimensions match the desired frequency range.

## Step 2: Designing Interdigital Transducers (IDTs)
IDTs generate and receive acoustic waves. Define their parameters carefully:
- **Finger width:** 0.1 mm
- **Spacing:** 0.2 mm
- **Number of pairs:** Typically 10 or more

Proper IDT configuration ensures efficient wave propagation.

## Step 3: Reflector Design
Reflectors guide acoustic waves and maximize reflection efficiency.

Recommended reflector dimensions:
- **Width:** 1 mm
- **Thickness:** 0.2 mm
- **Material:** Same as the substrate for optimal performance

## Step 4: Material Properties Assignment
Assign material properties for accurate simulations:
- **Density:** 4,650 kg/m³
- **Elastic Constants:** Specific to lithium niobate
- **Piezoelectric Coefficients:** Defined based on substrate characteristics

## Step 5: Meshing Considerations
Mesh refinement is critical for accurate simulation results. Suggested settings:
- **Element size:** 0.05 mm to 0.2 mm
- **Refinement:** High resolution near IDTs and reflectors

Fine meshing enhances wave propagation accuracy.

## Step 6: Defining Boundary Conditions
Set boundary conditions to simulate realistic device behavior:
- **Fixed constraints** on substrate edges to prevent unwanted displacement
- **Electrical potential definitions** on IDTs to generate and receive waves

## Step 7: Running Simulations
Execute the simulation and analyze wave propagation behavior. Monitor:
- **Resonant frequencies** (typically around 10 MHz)
- **Wave reflections and transmission efficiency**
- **Signal strength variations along the device**

Fine-tune material properties, geometries, and electrical parameters based on results.
