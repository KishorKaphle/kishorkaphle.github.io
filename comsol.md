## Capillary Simulation in COMSOL

**Overview:**  
Imagine designing a terry towel or bandageâ€”materials that need maximum fluid absorption. The absorption process is governed by capillary action, which depends on fiber geometry and the liquid-gas contact angle. This tutorial dives into how Multiphysics simulation can optimize such designs.

**Content:**  
1. **Introduction to Capillary Action**: Learn how fiber geometry and contact angles influence liquid absorption.  
2. **Simulation Approach**:  
   - Simulate capillary rise profiles for varying angles (30Â°, 45Â°, 68Â°).  
   - Validate results with theoretical studies, achieving 98% accuracy.

**Key Findings:**  
- Lower contact angles result in higher capillary rise.  
- Optimization focuses on fiber material and diameter for maximum fluid absorption.

**Pro Tips for COMSOL Simulation:**  
1. Adjust phase field parameters for better approximations.  
2. Define fluid properties correctly (fluid 1: gas, fluid 2: liquid).  
3. Use "suppress backflow" and hydrostatic pressure compensation as needed.

# **IMPORTANT COMSOL MEMS SIMULATION TRICKS!**

I am going to share some important and uncommon tricks that you rarely find elsewhere on the internet for MEMS simulation in COMSOL Multiphysics.

## **Challenges in Evaluating Electrical Response**
If you are a COMSOL user, you may have noticed that evaluating electrical response at the output terminal can be tricky. Defining output terminals for measurement in COMSOL physics is often cumbersome. While **probes** can be defined, probing and measuring the output response from the terminal is fundamentally different.

Defining terminals allows structured studies, such as **system control system design**, but assigning initial values and sources defeats the purpose of output signal analysis. To overcome this issue, I devised a simple and elegant trick.

## **Solution: Using an Electric Circuit Module**
The answer lies in **basic electric circuit principles**. We simply need to add a **voltage meter** across the output ports in the COMSOL model. Though integrating a multimeter into COMSOL geometry may sound complex, the implementation is straightforward with the **COMSOL Electric Circuit Module**.

However, I must note that the **circuit module interface** could be improvedâ€”currently, it lacks a graphical representation of where electrical elements (resistors, capacitors, sources, etc.) are placed. You must visualize the connections mentally or sketch a **schematic** in your notebook.

## **Important Notes on Using the Electric Circuit Module**
1. **Ground is usually node 0.** When connecting electrical elements, you directly connect them to nodesâ€”**no need to worry about wiring.**
2. **External terminals** must be defined in the electric circuit module. These terminals enable **communication between different physics** you have implemented.

## **Analyzing SAW Reflection on Boundaries**
I am currently studying the effects of **SAW reflection on the boundaries**. With the **Electric Circuit Module** integrated, I was able to **perform an in-depth analysis** of my **SAW delay line model**.

For this study:
- There is **no perfectly matched layer (PML) setup** on the device's **sides**, unlike at the **bottom** (see geometry below).
- Consequently, **reflection effects are pronounced** in the results (**see voltage profile, stress, and displacement values over different time points**).

## COMSOL Multiphysics simulation of Capillary Rise on a tube

# **Capillary Rise in COMSOL Multiphysics**

Capillary rise is a **spontaneous action** in which a liquid rises in a narrow tube due to fluid surface tension and the combination of **cohesive forces** of the liquid and **adhesive forces** between the liquid and tube material.

## **COMSOL Multiphysics Simulation**
I have conducted a **COMSOL Multiphysics simulation** to model the natural capillary rise action of water in a thin tube. COMSOL Support also provides a helpful tutorial on capillary filling, which you can find here:

### **Important Considerations for Capillary Rise Simulations**
When simulating capillary rise, it is crucial to select appropriate **boundary conditions**, including:
- **Wetted wall conditions**
- **Fluid inlet/outlet definitions**
- **Contact angle selection**

Proper implementation of these parameters ensures **accurate modeling of capillary phenomena**.

# **Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Sensors in MEMS Applications**

SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave) sensors are among the most popular **Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)**, widely used in:
- **Automotive systems**
- **Gadgets and consumer electronics**
- **Bioinstrumentation**
- **Industrial instrumentation systems**

## **COMSOL Multiphysics Simulation of SAW Sensors**
Below is an example of a **SAW sensor simulation** conducted using **COMSOL Multiphysics**.

### **Study Process**
1. **Finding suitable eigenmodes** for the system.
2. **AC excitation of the IDT (Interdigitated Electrode)** at a selected frequency.

The animation below illustrates how the **surface of piezoelectric material (LiNbOâ‚ƒ)** undergoes **periodic deformation** to generate a **surface wave (SAW).**

## **Working Principle**
- The generated **SAW propagates** through the **test substrate**.
- The **wave properties alter** as it passes, and these variations are detected at the receiving end.
- This detection enables **characterization of the test substrate**.

### **Enhancing the Sensor System**
To make the sensing system **more robust and accurate**, redundant elements such as **reflectors** can be introduced at **both ends of the IDT section**. Additionally, **signal acquisition and processing** are required for full sensor functionality.

## **Co-simulation with MATLAB/Simulink**
For an even more advanced simulation, **MATLAB/Simulink** can be integrated to model the **entire SAW sensor system**.

Stay tuned! I will be sharing a **co-simulation** study in an upcoming post.
